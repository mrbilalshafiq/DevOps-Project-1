# Halal World
> **_A business directory specifically for halal restaurants/take-aways_**

## Evolution of Software Application Designs

### Design 1

When I was told to work on a project that I would be passionate about, I decided to make an online version of my family business, which is mainly a fruit & veg shop.

Therefore when constructing my entity relational database diagram, it was based on this business model.

### Design 2

However, when it came to coding the tables using SQLAlchemy I realised that 4 tables was too complex to begin with for my first flask project. I then decided to change the business model to another idea that I had whilst abroad for my honeymoon which was an online business directory specifically for hospitality & catering businesses that sold halal food, so that muslims can find halal take-aways and restaurants when in another country. 

This idea was perfect to be a CRUD application as I always envisioned it being a user-generated directory meaning that the user adds the business to a database to be displayed on the website.

### Design 3

Although with only 2 tables, the amount of columns were proving to be a hinderance when testing if my application was performing correctly as it was being built. I then decided to have the least amount of columns possible, which is following the concept of MVP (Minimum Viable Product).
